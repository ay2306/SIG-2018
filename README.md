# Introduction to Competitive programming
## Why?
- Because its fun
- Helps learn programming deeply
- Asked in most of the interviews 
- Platform to prove yourself
## What we will cover?
1. Introduction to why algorithms are important and why they are important part of being a Computer Programmer
2. Big-O, Big-theta, Big-Ohmega Notations this includes time complexity and space complexity and also way to avoid tle error in program
3. Problem format
    - Problem statement
    - Input
    - Output
    - Estimating if a problem will run on our coding style
    - Estimated complexity we require to build solution
4. Simple Questions i.e. very easy from hackerearth, cakewalk or beginner from codechef and div2 A from codeforces
5. Algorithm paradigms
   - Brute force
   - Divide and Conquer
   - Greedy
   - Dynamic Programming
6. Data Structures and their algorithms
    - Arrays
    - Strings
        - Basic String Searching
        - Knuth Morris Pratt Algorithm

        - AVL and Red-Black tree
        - Heaps
            - Priority Queue
            - Heap Sort
            - Construction time of a heap
    - Graphs
        - Construction using adjacency list
        - Traversal DFS

        - Will See if more needs to be done
    - Hashing 
        - What is hashing.
        - Unneccessary theory but kinda important
    - Segment Tree
        - Basic

    - Stack
        - A simple introduction
        - Few important stack questions
    - Queue
        - Will be done before BFS traversal
    - Trie
7. Mathematics
    - Euclid's GCD
    -Mobius function
    - Prime Numbers
    - Sieve of Eratosthene
    - Golbach Conjecture
    - Will add on as I remember
